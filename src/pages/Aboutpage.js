                 <br />
                 Serendipitously, after saving up every penny that we had, we both
            set off on a life-changing solo backpacking trip and met each other
            along the way. Since then, we have traveled to countless countries
            and four continents together. Not knowing what to expect (or how to
            even run a travel blog), we started Adventure in You mainly because
            we wanted to stay connected to something that we loved which was
            traveling. Little did we know that starting a travel blog together
            would end up changing our lives as it has ultimately given us the
            freedom to work and live from anywhere in the world. Urban Travel
            Blog is a collective blog of expert travel writers, headed up by
            experienced travel journalist and editor Duncan Rhodes, who report
            on trends, experiences, festivals and nocturnal adventures in cities
            around Europe and the world. We publish lovingly-compiled ‘Long
            Weekend’ city guides to all our favourite destinations, as well as
            fresh and insightful feature articles on the quirkiest crazes, the
            most intriguing experiences and the best nightlife our boundless
            curiosity can uncover. (Just hover you mouse over the “Adventures”
            tab on our top menu to browse recent posts by category). And because
            everyone needs to smell the flowers – and not the coffee – once in a
            while, we like to offset our urban Odysseys with the occasional
            jaunt in the great outdoors in our Escape section.
